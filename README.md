# Interactive-Booking-Form
A simple multi-step booking form for users to schedule cargo shipments with simple input fields validation, dynamic pricing updates based on number of packages in shipment, total weight of shipment, scheduled date and time of shipment. All of which are open to modification. Design is also responsive across all devices, although, font sizes may be a little larger on smaller screens. 

The project utilises React Hook Form, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. I decided to keep the used packages at bare minimum to avoid overloading the simple project.

There are potential means to take this project further. I personally do not like the styling convention which I adopted but with the help of a Pro UX Designer, perhaps, we can do much more! APIs can also be integrated to actually submit the form and for dynamic pricing updates as well. But in the meantime, Cheers! CiaoðŸ¤©
